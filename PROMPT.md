Create a web-based 3D modeling program using Node.js to host the backend and WebGL to render everything in the browser. Include support for all the basic 3D primitives, including cubes, spheres, triangles, and any other shapes you can think of. Come up with a list of 3D primitives to include in the default set. Your list of primitives is too short. Create a Git repository in this directory if one does not exist - use the Unix `find` command to check. Meticulously add each of these items to a central `README.md` document which you will first create blank, commit, and then commit after adding all check boxes. Each primitive object shall be a new check box in the list. Make sure to optimize the application interface for mobile. Make sure the node.js webserver listens on localhost for a browser to connect to in order to show the frontend interface. Make sure to optimize the code. Use sqlite for persistent local storage. Create a `CONTEXT.md` file that you store all of your working context, ideas, and progress in, but treat it as a cache - once you're done with something in those working notes, clear it out. Commit changes to `CONTEXT.md` to the Git repository. Check for the existence of `gh` using Termux `pkg` commands. Take note of all install `pkg` and `npm` packages before getting started. Create a GitHub repository `nodist3d` and push each commit there as it happens. Explain that the name is Node.js + -ist + 3D. Create a suite of unit tests and a full test harness and test the full codebase. Make sure there is an interface button on the user controls of the web frontend to easily enter and leave full screen mode. Save this original prompt as `PROMPT.md`, commit it, and then never change it.
