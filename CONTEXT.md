## Working Context, Ideas, and Progress for nodist3d

### Current Focus:
- Implementing core primitives and updating `README.md`.

### Completed Tasks:
- Implemented Box (Cube), Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Torus, Torus Knot, Tetrahedron, Icosahedron, Dodecahedron, Octahedron, Plane, Tube, and Teapot primitives.
- Refactored frontend into `SceneManager.js` and `ObjectManager.js`.
- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive checklist and roadmap.
- Initial Git repository setup and continuous pushing to GitHub.
- Temporarily removed database dependency from `package.json` to resolve `npm install` issues.

### Next Steps:
- Implement interactive controls for object manipulation (translate, rotate, scale).
- Add a property panel to adjust primitive parameters.
- Implement a scene graph/outliner.
- Implement unit tests and a full test harness.
- Implement custom zip file format for local storage.

### Ideas & Notes:
- Consider using dat.GUI or similar library for easier UI control generation.
- Explore WebGL performance optimizations for mobile devices.
- Research best practices for 3D model persistence in web applications.
- Investigate database build issue on Termux and re-integrate if possible.
