## Working Context, Ideas, and Progress for nodist3d

### Current Focus:
- Optimizing the code for performance.

### Completed Tasks:
- Optimized font loading in `ObjectManager.js` by loading the font once in the constructor and removing duplicate `addLathe`, `addExtrude`, and `addText` functions.

### New Memory:
- When `replace` tool fails due to multiple matches or complex replacements, rebuild the full file content into a temporary file and then move it to replace the original. No need to `git add` if the filename is the same.

### Next Steps:
- Continue examining `src/frontend/main.js` for further optimization opportunities.
- Prioritize next roadmap features based on the `README.md`.
