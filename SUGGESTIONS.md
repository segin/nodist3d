### I. Architecture & General Improvements

1.  **Dependency Injection**: Instead of managers accessing each other globally, use a central container or dependency injection (DI) to manage class instances. This will decouple your modules and make them easier to test.
2.  **Centralized State Management**: The application state is currently scattered across various managers and DOM elements. Centralize it in a main `App` class or a dedicated state management object to improve predictability and simplify data flow.
3.  **Implement an Event Bus**: Decouple managers by using a publish/subscribe event bus. Instead of direct method calls like `objectManager.add()`, a manager would emit an event like `events.publish('objectAdded', data)`.
4.  **Externalize Configuration**: Move hardcoded values like the server port (`3000`), WebSocket URL, and history size into a separate configuration file or use environment variables.
5.  **Refactor `main.js`**: Break down the large `init()` function in `main.js` into smaller, focused functions (e.g., `setupRenderer()`, `setupCamera()`, `initializeUI()`, `setupEventListeners()`).
6.  **Consistent Module System**: The project mixes CommonJS (`require` in `server.js`) and ES Modules (`import`). Standardize on ES Modules by adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json` and updating `server.js` syntax.
7.  **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Add `try...catch` blocks for operations that can fail, such as `localStorage` access, WebSocket connections, and data parsing.
8.  **Use a Logger**: Replace all `console.log()` calls with a proper logging library (e.g., `loglevel` on the frontend) that allows for different log levels (debug, info, warn, error).
9.  **Add JSDoc Comments**: Document all classes and public methods using JSDoc comments. This will improve code clarity and enable automatic documentation generation.
10. **Define Constants**: Create a `constants.js` file for "magic strings" like event names (`'object-added'`), object types (`'box'`), and UI IDs to prevent typos and improve maintainability.

### II. Backend (`src/backend/server.js`)

11. **Robust File Paths**: Use `path.join(__dirname, ...)` to construct the static file path. This prevents path issues across different operating systems.
12. **Add Security Middleware**: Use `helmet` in your Express server to set secure HTTP headers and protect against common web vulnerabilities.
13. **Enable CORS**: Implement the `cors` middleware to handle cross-origin requests, which will be necessary if the API and frontend are served on different ports or domains.
14. **Handle WebSocket Errors**: Add an `'error'` event listener to each WebSocket connection to log errors and prevent the server from crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
15. **Use Environment Variables for Port**: Read the server port from `process.env.PORT` with a fallback to `3000` to make deployment easier.
16. **Refactor WebSocket Broadcasting**: The current broadcast iterates through all clients. For better performance, consider implementing a room-based system if you need to send messages to specific client groups.

### III. Frontend - JavaScript & Logic

17. **Refactor WebSocket Message Handling**: The large `if/else if` block in `main.js`'s `ws.onmessage` handler is inefficient. Refactor it into a `switch` statement or, even better, a handler map object (`const messageHandlers = { 'type': handlerFunc, ... }`).
18. **Create an Input Manager**: Centralize all mouse and keyboard event listeners (`mousedown`, `keyup`, etc.) into a dedicated `InputManager` class instead of attaching them directly to the `window` or `document` in `main.js`.
19. **Leverage Modern JavaScript**: Use modern ES6+ features like optional chaining (`?.`), nullish coalescing (`??`), and `async/await` to write more concise and readable code.
20. **Implement Placeholder Files**: The files `PhysicsManager.js` and `ShaderEditor.js` are empty. Either implement their functionality or remove them from the project.
21. **Factory Pattern for Objects**: Refactor the `createObject` switch statement in `ObjectManager` into a factory pattern. This makes adding new object types cleaner and more scalable.
22. **Cache and Reuse Materials**: In `ObjectManager`, instead of creating a `new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial()` every time, cache materials based on their properties and reuse them to reduce draw calls and improve performance.
23. **Improve `Pointer.js` Decoupling**: While `Pointer.js` uses custom events (good!), it still seems to rely on global state. Refactor it to receive necessary state (like the list of selectable objects) via its methods.
24. **Clean up `main.js` Event Listeners**: Organize all UI event listeners from `main.js` into a separate `UIMediator` or similar class that handles interactions between the DOM and the 3D scene managers.

### IV. Frontend - Three.js & Scene Management

25. **Use Built-in Scene Serialization**: Replace your custom `sceneManager.toJSON` and `fromJSON` logic. Use the robust built-in `scene.toJSON()` and `THREE.ObjectLoader` to handle scene serialization and parsing.
26. **Ensure Complete Resource Disposal**: Perform an audit to ensure all Three.js objects (geometries, materials, textures) are properly disposed of with `.dispose()` when they are removed from the scene to prevent memory leaks.
27. **Manage Control Toggling**: When `TransformControls` are activated, explicitly disable `OrbitControls` (`orbitControls.enabled = false;`) to prevent the two from interfering with each other.
28. **Set Device Pixel Ratio**: Call `renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio)` to ensure your scene renders crisply on HiDPI (Retina) displays.
29. **Abstract `SceneGraph.js` DOM Manipulation**: The `SceneGraph.js` module directly manipulates the DOM heavily. Abstract this into smaller functions and use template literals to build HTML strings instead of `document.createElement`. This makes the code much cleaner.

### V. Frontend - HTML & CSS

30. **Use Semantic HTML**: In `index.html`, replace layout tables (`<table id="properties-panel-table">`) and excessive `div`s with semantic HTML5 elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`) and use modern CSS for layout.
31. **Remove Inline Styles & Event Handlers**: Move all inline `style="..."` attributes to `style.css` and replace all `onclick="..."` attributes with `addEventListener` calls in your JavaScript.
32. **Make the Layout Responsive**: Replace fixed-pixel widths and `position: absolute` in `style.css` with a flexible, responsive design using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
33. **Use CSS Classes Over IDs**: Prioritize styling with classes instead of IDs in `style.css`. This reduces specificity and makes styles more reusable.
34. **Introduce CSS Variables**: Use CSS Custom Properties (variables) for common values like colors, fonts, and spacing to make theming and maintenance easier.
35. **Adopt a CSS Naming Convention**: Use a structured naming convention like BEM (`.block__element--modifier`) for your CSS classes to improve readability and avoid style conflicts.
36. **Remove `!important`**: Refactor the CSS to remove all uses of `!important`, as this is often a sign of underlying specificity issues.
37. **Improve Accessibility (A11y)**: Add `aria-` attributes, use `<button>` elements for buttons, provide labels for inputs, and ensure all UI is navigable via keyboard.

### VI. Testing & Tooling

38. **Increase Test Coverage**: The existing tests are minimal. Write comprehensive unit tests for all public methods in your manager classes, covering both success and failure cases.
39. **Mock Dependencies in Tests**: Use Jest's mocking capabilities (`jest.mock()`) to properly isolate the units you are testing. For example, `ObjectManager` tests should use a mocked `SceneManager`.
40. **Test the Backend Logic**: Expand `backend.test.js` to test the WebSocket connection and message broadcasting logic, not just that the server starts.
41. **Add End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Use a framework like Cypress or Playwright to create E2E tests that simulate user workflows from the browser.
42. **Use a Bundler**: Integrate a modern bundler like Vite or Webpack. This will automate module bundling, minification, and provide a better development server experience.
43. **Install a Linter and Formatter**: Add ESLint and Prettier to your project to enforce a consistent code style and catch common errors early.
44. **Use Pre-commit Hooks**: Use Husky and lint-staged to automatically run the linter on your code before every commit, ensuring code quality.
45. **Update Dependencies**: Run `npm outdated` to check for stale packages and update them to their latest stable versions for security and performance benefits.
46. **Specify Node Version**: Add an `engines` field to `package.json` to specify the Node.js version your project requires.

### VII. Documentation & UX

47. **Enhance the README**: Update `README.md` with a clear project description, detailed setup instructions, an architectural overview, and instructions for running tests.
48. **Provide User Feedback**: Add loading indicators, visual feedback on button clicks, and clear status messages (e.g., "Scene saved!").
49. **Improve UI Layout**: Re-evaluate the UI layout for better ergonomics. Group related controls and ensure property panels are easy to read and interact with.
50. **Graceful `localStorage` Failure**: Wrap `localStorage` calls in `try...catch` blocks to handle cases where storage is disabled (e.g., in private browsing) or full, and inform the user gracefully.
51. **Clearer Variable Naming**: Improve the clarity of variable names where appropriate. For example, rename the generic `object` variable to `selectedObject` in contexts where an object is selected.

### VIII. Advanced Architecture & Decoupling

52. **State Machine for Application Modes**: Implement a finite state machine (FSM) to manage application modes (e.g., `IDLE`, `TRANSFORMING_OBJECT`, `EDITING_MATERIAL`) instead of using boolean flags.
53. **Service Locator Pattern**: As an alternative to DI, implement a Service Locator to provide access to shared services like managers, reducing the need for global variables.
54. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Break down large manager classes. For example, `ObjectManager` could be split into `ObjectFactory`, `ObjectSelector`, and `ObjectPropertyUpdater`.
55. **Command Pattern for History**: Refactor `History.js` to use the Command pattern. Each action (add, remove, transform) becomes a command object with `execute()` and `undo()` methods, simplifying the history logic.
56. **Data-Oriented Design for Properties**: Instead of storing properties directly on Three.js objects, maintain a separate data structure (e.g., a map of UUIDs to property objects). This separates app state from view state.
57. **Create a Core `Engine` Class**: Encapsulate the `renderer`, `scene`, and `camera` setup and the animation loop inside a main `Engine` class to abstract Three.js boilerplate from `main.js`.
58. **Decouple UI from Logic**: `SceneGraph.js` currently mixes logic with direct DOM manipulation. Refactor it to emit events like `sceneGraphNeedsUpdate` with data, and have a separate `UIRenderer` class handle the DOM changes.
59. **Abstract WebSocket Communication**: Create a `NetworkManager` class that wraps the WebSocket instance, providing methods like `send(type, payload)` and handling connection/reconnection logic internally.
60. **Modularize Managers**: Convert manager classes into true ES modules that do not create their own instances. Instantiation should be handled by a single top-level script (`main.js`).
61. **Avoid `instanceof` Checks**: Replace `instanceof` checks (e.g., to see if an object is a `Mesh` or `Light`) with a component-based approach or by checking for properties/methods (duck typing).

### IX. Code Quality & Modernization

62. **Use Class Private Fields**: Adopt `#privateField` syntax for class properties and methods that are not meant to be accessed from outside the class.
63. **Avoid Default Exports**: Prefer named exports to improve discoverability and refactoring.
64. **Use Object Destructuring**: Use destructuring in function parameters and variable assignments to make code more concise (e.g., `const { position, rotation } = selectedObject;`).
65. **Adopt `async/await` for Promises**: Refactor any `.then().catch()` chains to the more readable `async/await` syntax.
66. **Immutable Data Structures**: For state management, consider using immutable data structures (or libraries like Immer) to prevent accidental state mutation and simplify change detection.
67. **Null-safe Property Access**: In `updatePropertiesPanel`, use optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access properties of a potentially null `selectedObject`.
68. **Enforce Stricter ESLint Rules**: Add plugins like `eslint-plugin-promise` and `eslint-plugin-unicorn` for more advanced linting rules.
69. **Remove Dead Code**: Systematically identify and remove unused variables, functions, and commented-out code blocks.
70. **Use Template Literals for DOM Strings**: When creating HTML strings (like in `SceneGraph.js`), use template literals instead of string concatenation for better readability and multiline support.
71. **Avoid `for...in` for Arrays**: Never use `for...in` to iterate over arrays. Use `for...of` or array methods like `forEach`.
72. **Explicit Type Coercion**: Avoid implicit type coercion by using `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`.

### X. Performance Optimizations

73. **Debounce Expensive Event Listeners**: Debounce the `window.onresize` event handler to prevent excessive re-rendering while the user is resizing the window.
74. **Throttle Mouse Move Events**: Throttle `mousemove` events used for raycasting or UI updates to reduce CPU load.
75. **Optimize Raycasting**: When raycasting, pass a specific list of objects to `raycaster.intersectObjects()` instead of the entire scene to improve performance.
76. **Implement Object Pooling**: For objects that are created and destroyed frequently (e.g., temporary markers), use an object pooling pattern to recycle instances and reduce garbage collection.
77. **Virtualize UI Lists**: For the `SceneGraph`, if scenes can get very large, implement UI virtualization so that only the visible items in the list are rendered in the DOM.
78. **Optimize Shadow Maps**: Fine-tune shadow map size (`light.shadow.mapSize`) and camera frustum (`light.shadow.camera`) to balance shadow quality and performance.
79. **Freeze Static Objects**: For objects that will not move, set `object.matrixAutoUpdate = false` after positioning them and manually call `object.updateMatrix()` once.
80. **Analyze with `Spector.js`**: Integrate a tool like `Spector.js` to debug and analyze the sequence of WebGL calls being made per frame.
81. **Selective `render()` Calls**: Only call `renderer.render()` when something has actually changed in the scene, instead of in a continuous `requestAnimationFrame` loop, for static scenes.
82. **Use `BufferGeometry` Directly**: When possible, manipulate `BufferGeometry` attributes directly instead of creating new geometry instances for minor changes.
83. **Disable Unnecessary Renderer Options**: Conditionally disable `antialias` on low-power devices or via a user setting to save performance.

### XI. Frontend - UI/UX Enhancements

84. **Implement Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., `Ctrl+S` for Save, `Ctrl+Z`/`Y` for Undo/Redo, `G` for Group, `Delete` for remove).
85. **Visual Cues for Hover vs. Select**: Use different visual indicators (e.g., a subtle outline for hover, a strong outline or gizmo for selection) to make the state clearer.
86. **Custom Confirmation Modals**: Replace native browser `confirm()` dialogs with custom, non-blocking modal windows for a better user experience.
87. **Add Tooltips**: Provide tooltips for all toolbar icons and property fields to explain their function.
88. **Implement a Color Picker**: Replace the text input for color properties with a proper visual color picker component.
89. **Numeric Input Steppers**: For numeric properties like position and scale, use input fields with stepper arrows to allow for incremental changes.
90. **Snapping and Alignment Tools**: Add options for grid snapping or axis alignment while transforming objects.
91. **A 'Welcome' or 'Help' Modal**: Create a modal that explains the basic controls and UI for first-time users.
92. **Draggable UI Panels**: Allow the user to reposition UI panels like the properties editor and scene graph.
93. **Progress Indicators for Slow Operations**: Show a spinner or progress bar when loading or saving large scenes.
94. **Search/Filter in Scene Graph**: Add a search bar to filter the object list in the `SceneGraph` UI.
95. **Context Menus**: Implement right-click context menus on objects in the viewport and in the scene graph for quick access to actions.

### XII. Frontend - Advanced Three.js

96. **Use Instanced Rendering**: If you need to render many copies of the same object, use `THREE.InstancedMesh` for a massive performance boost.
97. **Implement Post-Processing**: Add a post-processing pipeline using `EffectComposer` to add effects like bloom, depth of field, or custom shaders.
98. **Support Orthographic Cameras**: Add a toggle between `PerspectiveCamera` and `OrthographicCamera` for different modeling styles.
99. **Add Scene Fog**: Add `scene.fog` for atmospheric effect and to obscure distant objects.
100. **Use `LOD` (Level of Detail)**: For complex models, use `THREE.LOD` to automatically switch to lower-polygon versions of the model as it moves further from the camera.
101. **Integrate a Real Physics Engine**: Fully implement `PhysicsManager.js` using a library like `Cannon-es` or `Rapier` to enable dynamic simulations.
102. **Custom Shaders in `ShaderEditor.js`**: Implement the `ShaderEditor.js` to allow users to write and apply custom GLSL vertex and fragment shaders to objects.
103. **Support GLTF Model Loading**: Add functionality to import and handle complex 3D models in `gltf` or `glb` format.
104. **Environment Maps**: Implement environment maps for realistic reflections on `MeshStandardMaterial` or `MeshPhysicalMaterial`.

### XIII. Security Hardening

105. **DOM Input Sanitization**: Sanitiz all user input in property panels before using it to update object properties or the DOM to prevent XSS attacks.
106. **WebSocket Message Validation**: On the server, validate the structure and content of incoming WebSocket messages with a schema before processing them.
107. **Add a Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a restrictive CSP via meta tags or HTTP headers to mitigate injection attacks.
108. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate `npm audit` into your CI pipeline to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
109. **Secure `target="_blank"` Links**: Ensure any links that open in a new tab have `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent tab-nabbing.
110. **Rate Limiting on Server**: Implement rate limiting on the WebSocket server to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or spam.
111. **JSON Serialization Security**: Be aware of prototype poisoning vulnerabilities when parsing JSON from untrusted sources. Use `JSON.parse` safely.

### XIV. Backend & WebSocket Enhancements

112. **Graceful Server Shutdown**: Implement logic to gracefully shut down the server, closing all WebSocket connections and saving any necessary state.
113. **Structured Logging**: Log server events as structured JSON objects instead of plain text for easier querying and analysis in log management systems.
114. **Implement WebSocket Heartbeat**: Add a ping/pong mechanism to detect and close dead WebSocket connections.
115. **Add a Health Check Endpoint**: Create a simple HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/healthz`) that returns a `200 OK` status, useful for deployment environments.
116. **WebSocket Message Versioning**: Include a version number in your WebSocket message protocol to allow for backward-compatible changes in the future.
117. **Centralized Error Handling in Express**: Use a dedicated Express error-handling middleware to catch all unhandled route errors.

### XV. Advanced Testing & Quality Assurance

118. **Snapshot Testing for UI**: Use Jest snapshot testing to track changes to the HTML structure generated by `SceneGraph.js`.
119. **Visual Regression Testing**: Implement visual regression testing with a tool like Percy or Storybook to catch unintended visual changes in the 3D canvas or UI.
120. **Measure Test Coverage**: Configure Jest to generate a test coverage report and set coverage thresholds to enforce testing standards.
121. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Set up an automated pipeline using a service like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to run your tests on different browsers and operating systems.
122. **Test `History.js` Edge Cases**: Write specific tests for undo/redo logic, such as what happens when you undo everything and then perform a new action.
123. **Test Raycasting Logic**: Write tests for `Pointer.js` to ensure it correctly identifies objects under the cursor and handles empty clicks.
124. **Fuzz Testing**: Send random or malformed data through the WebSocket connection and property panels to uncover unexpected errors.
125. **Performance Testing**: Create benchmark tests to measure key metrics like scene load time and frames per second (FPS) under specific conditions.

### XVI. Build Process & Tooling Improvements

126. **Separate Dev/Prod Builds**: Create distinct build configurations in your bundler for development (with source maps, hot reloading) and production (minified, optimized).
127. **Generate Source Maps**: Ensure source maps are generated for production builds to make debugging errors in the wild easier.
128. **Implement a CI/CD Pipeline**: Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to automate the process of running tests, linting, and deploying the application.
129. **Containerize with Docker**: Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to define a consistent, reproducible environment for development and deployment.
130. **Enable Tree Shaking**: Ensure your bundler is configured to perform tree shaking to eliminate unused code from the final bundle, especially from large libraries like Three.js.
131. **Implement Code Splitting**: Split your application code into smaller chunks (e.g., by route or feature) that can be loaded on demand to improve initial load time.
132. **Automate Dependency Updates**: Use a service like Dependabot or Renovate to automatically create pull requests for updating outdated dependencies.

### XVII. Documentation & Project Management

133. **Create an Architectural Decision Record (ADR)**: Maintain a log of important architectural decisions, why they were made, and their consequences.
134. **Document the WebSocket API**: Create a clear document defining the WebSocket message types, their payloads, and their purpose.
135. **Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` File**: If the project is open source, add a file that outlines how others can contribute, including coding standards and the pull request process.
136. **Generate Documentation from JSDoc**: Use a tool like `JSDoc` or `TypeDoc` to automatically generate an HTML documentation website from your code comments.
137. **Set up Project Boards**: Use GitHub Projects or a similar tool to organize tasks, track bugs, and plan future features.
138. **Create a `changelog.md`**: Maintain a log of changes, bug fixes, and new features for each version release.
139. **Add inline comments for complex logic**: Beyond JSDoc, add comments inside complex functions to explain *why* the code is written a certain way, not just *what* it does.
140. **Document Build and Deployment Steps**: Add a section to the `README.md` that clearly explains how to build the project for production and deploy it.

### XVIII. TypeScript Migration & Static Analysis

141. **Incremental TypeScript Adoption**: Begin migrating to TypeScript file-by-file, starting with utility functions and constants, using `// @ts-check` in JS files to catch early errors.
142. **Define Core Types**: Create `types.ts` (or similar) to define shared interfaces for core concepts like `SceneObject`, `MaterialProperties`, and `UserAction`.
143. **Use Mapped Types for UI**: Create types for UI state that are derived from your core data types, ensuring consistency.
144. **Strict Type Checking**: Enable all `strict` mode options in `tsconfig.json` (`strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`, etc.) for maximum type safety.
145. **Use Utility Types**: Leverage TypeScript's built-in utility types like `Partial<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, and `Pick<T, K>` to create flexible and robust types.
146. **Type Guard Functions**: Implement type guard functions (e.g., `isMesh(obj): obj is THREE.Mesh`) to narrow types within conditional blocks, replacing `instanceof` checks.
147. **Typed Event Bus**: If implementing an event bus, make it type-safe so that `publish('eventName', payload)` validates that the payload matches the event's expected type.
148. **Generate Types from Schemas**: If using a schema validation library for WebSocket messages, use it to automatically generate TypeScript types.
149. **Lint for TypeScript Best Practices**: Use ` @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` to enforce best practices specific to TypeScript.
150. **Use `unknown` Instead of `any`**: Prefer `unknown` for values with a truly unknown type and perform explicit type checking before use.
151. **Define Enums for Categories**: Use string enums for categorical data like object types (`ObjectType.BOX`, `ObjectType.SPHERE`) to prevent typos and provide autocompletion.

### XIX. Advanced State & Data Management

152. **Use State Management Library**: Adopt a dedicated state management library like Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Jotai to handle complex state interactions, especially if the UI becomes more reactive.
153. **Selectors for Derived Data**: Use memoized selectors (like with `reselect`) to compute derived data from your state, preventing unnecessary recalculations.
154. **State Normalization**: Normalize nested or relational data in your state store. Instead of arrays of objects, use an "entities" object keyed by ID for faster lookups.
155. **Separate UI State from Domain State**: Keep transient UI state (e.g., "is this panel open?") separate from the core application/domain state (the scene data).
156. **Optimistic UI Updates**: For network actions, update the UI immediately as if the action succeeded, then roll back only if the server returns an error. This improves perceived performance.
157. **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**: For real-time collaboration, investigate CRDTs to merge changes from different users without conflicts.
158. **Use a Web Worker for Heavy Computation**: Offload heavy tasks like scene serialization/deserialization or complex physics calculations to a Web Worker to keep the main UI thread responsive.
159. **IndexedDB for Large-Scale Storage**: If scenes or assets become very large, migrate from `localStorage` to IndexedDB for its larger storage capacity and asynchronous API.
160. **Data Schema Versioning and Migration**: Implement a versioning system for your saved scene format (`.json` or `localStorage`) and write migration scripts to handle loading older versions.

### XX. Collaboration & Real-Time Features

161. **User Presence Indicators**: Show a list of currently active users in a session.
162. **Live Cursors**: Display the cursors of other users moving around the 2D UI or 3D space.
163. **Component Locking**: Allow a user to "lock" an object they are editing to prevent other users from modifying it simultaneously.
164. **Live Chat/Annotations**: Add a chat panel or the ability for users to drop 3D annotations into the scene.
165. **Operational Transformation (OT)**: As an alternative to CRDTs, implement OT for synchronizing user edits, which is well-suited for structured data like a scene graph.
166. **Session Management**: Allow users to create named sessions/rooms that others can join via a URL.
167. **Backend State Persistence**: Persist the state of a collaborative scene on the backend (e.g., in a Redis or in-memory database) so it can be re-joined later.
168. **Permissions/Roles**: Introduce user roles (e.g., editor, viewer) to control who can make changes in a shared session.

### XXI. User Experience & Interface Polish

169. **Drag-to-Adjust Numeric Inputs**: Allow users to click and drag horizontally on a number input label to quickly scrub through values.
170. **Customizable UI Themes**: Add light and dark mode themes, and potentially allow users to customize theme colors.
171. **Command Palette**: Implement a command palette (like in VS Code) that can be opened with a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`) to quickly access any action.
172. **Marquee (Box) Selection**: Allow users to drag a rectangle on the screen to select multiple objects at once.
173. **In-Viewport Property Display**: Briefly show key properties (like an object's name) next to it in the viewport upon selection.
174. **Accessible Color Palettes**: Ensure that default colors and UI themes have sufficient contrast ratios to meet WCAG AA or AAA standards.
175. **UI State in URL**: Store some UI state (like the active panel or selected object ID) in the URL hash, so refreshing the page restores the user's context.
176. **Empty States**: Design helpful "empty state" messages for panels like the scene graph (e.g., "No objects in scene. Click 'Add' to get started!").
177. **Micro-interactions**: Add subtle animations and transitions to UI elements to provide feedback and make the interface feel more dynamic.
178. **Multi-Select Property Editing**: When multiple objects are selected, the properties panel should show common editable properties (e.g., `visible`) and indicate mixed states for differing ones.
179. **Save/Dirty Indicator**: Show a visual indicator (e.g., an asterisk in the title) when the scene has unsaved changes.

### XXII. Asset & Resource Management

180. **Asset Browser UI**: Create a dedicated UI panel for managing imported assets like textures, models, and materials.
181. **Drag-and-Drop Asset Import**: Allow users to drag files (e.g., `.png`, `.gltf`) directly into the browser window to import them.
182. **Texture Compression**: Use a library like `KTX-Software` to compress textures into GPU-friendly formats (like KTX2 / Basis Universal) for faster loading and lower memory usage.
183. **Reference Counting for Assets**: Implement reference counting for assets so that textures or materials are only unloaded from memory when no objects are using them.
184. **Lazy Loading for Assets**: Only load the data for heavy assets (like high-res textures) when they are actually needed in the scene.
185. **Asset Preloading**: Preload critical assets while showing a loading screen to ensure they are available immediately when the main application starts.

### XXIII. Accessibility (A11y) Deep Dive

186. **Focus Management**: Ensure that when modals open, focus is trapped inside them, and when they close, focus returns to the element that triggered them.
187. **Live Regions for Notifications**: Use ARIA live regions (`aria-live="polite"`) for status messages so screen readers announce them automatically.
188. **Full Keyboard Navigation for 3D Viewport**: Implement keyboard controls for orbiting, panning, and zooming the 3D camera.
189. **Accessible `canvas` Element**: Provide a fallback text description inside the `<canvas>` element and use a hidden list of scene objects that a screen reader can announce.
190. **High Contrast Mode**: Implement a specific high-contrast UI theme that overrides other color settings for users who need it.
191. **Reduce Motion Setting**: Respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable non-essential animations and transitions.
192. **Screen Reader Text for Icons**: For icon-only buttons, use a visually hidden `<span>` with descriptive text inside the `<button>` for screen readers.

### XXIV. Code & Project Structure Refinements

193. **Feature-Based Directory Structure**: Organize files by feature (e.g., `/features/scene-graph`, `/features/properties-panel`) instead of by type (`/managers`, `/ui`).
194. **Barrel Files (`index.js`)**: Use `index.js` or `index.ts` files to create a clean public API for each feature directory, simplifying imports.
195. **Separate Public/Internal APIs**: Clearly distinguish between a module's public API and its internal implementation details, possibly using an `internal` subdirectory.
196. **Monorepo Structure**: If the project grows, consider a monorepo structure (using `npm workspaces`, `pnpm`, or `Nx`) to manage the backend, frontend, and shared libraries in one repository.
197. **`.editorconfig` File**: Add an `.editorconfig` file to the root of the project to enforce consistent basic editor settings (indentation, line endings) across different IDEs.
198. **Path Aliases**: Configure path aliases (e.g., ` @/components/*`) in your bundler and `tsconfig.json` to avoid long relative import paths (`../../..`).

### XXV. Advanced Rendering & Graphics
