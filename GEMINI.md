## Gemini Added Memories
- Always perform a `git push` after each and every `git commit`.
- To test frontend code in a Node.js environment, I can use a virtual DOM library like JSDOM or Happy DOM. This allows running tests with `npm test` without a browser. I should configure the testing framework (e.g., Jest) to use one of these environments.
- Always `git commit` and `git push` after each and every change.
- When implementing test cases, it is a requirement to implement only one at a time. You must only check off one completed test unit per `git commit` and `git push`.

Create a web-based 3D modeling program using Node.js to host the backend and WebGL to render everything in the browser. Include support for all the basic 3D primitives, including cubes, spheres, triangles, and any other shapes you can think of. Come up with a list of 3D primitives to include in the default set. Your list of primitives is too short. Create a Git repository in this directory if one does not exist - use the Unix `find` command to check. Meticulously add each of these items to a central `README.md` document which you will first create blank, commit, and then commit after adding all check boxes. Each primitive object shall be a new check box in the list. Make sure to optimize the application interface for mobile. Make sure the node.js webserver listens on localhost for a browser to connect to in order to show the frontend interface. Make sure to optimize the code. Use a custom zip file format with JSON data inside for persistent local storage. Create a `CONTEXT.md` file that you store all of your working context, ideas, and progress in, but treat it as a cache - once you're done with something in those working notes, clear it out. Commit changes to `CONTEXT.md` to the Git repository. Check for the existence of `gh` using Termux `pkg` commands. Take note of all install `pkg` and `npm` packages before getting started. Create a GitHub repository `nodist3d` and push each commit there as it happens. Explain that the name is Node.js + -ist + 3D. Create a suite of unit tests and a full test harness and test the full codebase. Make sure there is an interface button on the user controls of the web frontend to easily enter and leave full screen mode. Save this original prompt as `PROMPT.md`, commit it, and then never change it.

*Directive: This file, `GEMINI.md`, must be updated with the latest status of the work after each significant change.*
*Directive: If the user requests that I add or remember any directives, they should be saved to this project's `GEMINI.md`.*
*Directive: Always update the contents of the `GEMINI.js` file with the current subtask you are working on. Ensure that if you are completely interrupted and reset, you are able to adequately restore your working state as to be able to resume your work without significant interruption.*
*Directive: After every `git commit`, the immediate next action should be a `git push` with the sole exception of the commit failing - in that case, resolve the commit failure, and then `git push`.*
*Directive: When implementing test cases, it is a requirement to implement only one at a time. You must only check off one completed test unit per `git commit` and `git push`.*
*Directive: Scan the codebase and suggest 500 possible improvements. Combine them with suggestions file. Make the whole thing a checklist. Implement only one item at a time, then make `git commit` and `git push` before moving on to the next item.*

## Working Context, Ideas, and Progress for nodist3d

*Directive: This section must be updated by the AI agent after each significant change to maintain working state continuity.*
*Directive: The AI agent must update the "Current Focus" section to reflect the exact task being worked on.*
*Directive: The AI agent must move completed tasks from "Current Focus" to "Completed Tasks" section.*
*Directive: The AI agent must update "Next Steps" with the immediate next actions based on the roadmap.*

### Current Focus:
- Successfully completed the next three roadmap items:
  1. Property panel for primitive parameters (COMPLETED)
  2. Scene graph/outliner for object management (COMPLETED)
  3. Undo functionality (COMPLETED)
- Ready to continue with additional roadmap features

### Completed Tasks:
- Reset all roadmap items to unchecked to start fresh implementation
- Implemented clean, simplified App class architecture with basic interactive controls
- Added TransformControls for translate, rotate, scale operations
- Implemented click-to-select functionality with visual feedback
- Added keyboard shortcuts (G=translate, R=rotate, S=scale)
- Created working test suite with proper mocks for THREE.js components
- Basic primitives: Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Torus, Plane
- Object duplication and deletion features
- Grid and axis helpers for better orientation
- Fixed test architecture issues by simplifying the codebase
- ✅ COMPLETED: Interactive controls for object manipulation (translate, rotate, scale) - commit 291e5f9
- ✅ COMPLETED: Property panel for primitive parameters with real-time geometry updates - commit 2959e0a
- ✅ COMPLETED: Scene graph/outliner for object management with visibility toggles - commit 89c1fae
- ✅ COMPLETED: Undo functionality with history system and keyboard shortcuts - commit pending

### Implementation Strategy:
- Follow one-by-one implementation with individual commits and pushes
- Each roadmap item gets its own commit with comprehensive testing
- Maintain working state by updating this file continuously
- Use clean, maintainable code patterns that are easy to extend

### Next Steps:
1. Add property panel to adjust primitive parameters (dimensions, radius, etc.)
2. Implement scene graph/outliner for managing multiple objects
3. Add undo functionality for actions
4. Continue with remaining roadmap items systematically
